Storing and retrieving associated documents

Managing roles and permissions

The project includes RESTful API endpoints, example datasets, and environment configurations for rapid deployment.


Requirements
Docker

Docker Compose

bash shell (for running test scripts)

Installation & Running
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Build and run with Docker
bash
Copiar
Editar
docker-compose up --build
This will start all necessary services for the API.

How to Test the API
Once the application is running, you can use the provided shell scripts to execute API requests quickly.

From Delivery 1 (basic repository operations)
bash
Copiar
Editar
cd delivery1
chmod +x repository_commands
./repository_commands
From Delivery 2 (extended operations and permissions)
bash
Copiar
Editar
cd delivery2
chmod +x test_commands.sh
./test_commands.sh
These scripts execute a predefined sequence of API calls, including:

Creating organizations

Adding documents

Managing roles and permissions

Retrieving files

You can also open the scripts and run each command individually to better understand how the API works.
